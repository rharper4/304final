        <h2>Our Team's Choice: ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>Our team chose the topic of artificial intelligence, more specifically, ChatGPT - a Generative Pre-trained Transformer. 
            ChatGPT, short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. It is a complex natural language processing technology that falls under artificial intelligence. 
            ChatGPT purpose is to generate human-like text based on the inputs the user put in.
            It gained a lot of traction recently due to the nature that  it can quickly understand and produce an accurate output, 
            making it a significant advancement in the field of technology. It has only taken ChatGPT to reach 1 million users in 5 days. Down below shows some famous application who took way longer to reach a million users.</p>
